= model_form(beta)

* Generate form with one line of code.

== Overview
* This Gem act as a wrapper to simple_form gem and bootstrap.
* You can use this gem to create forms in quickest possible way.
* If you are already using simple_form gem in your application, you can use this gem to avoid writing code.

== Usage
* Add gem 'model_form' to your Gemfile
* Run bundle
* Add model_form(instance_of_model) eg. <%= model_form(@user) %>
* You can also pass the same number of parameters as of simple_form_for
* e.g. <%= model_form @user, url: 'users/someurl', html: { class: 'form-vertical'} %>
* You can also explicitly specify fields that you want on a particular form by using fields options
 <%= model_form @user, url: 'users/someurl', html: { class: 'form-vertical'}, fields: ['first_name','contact_number'] %>
